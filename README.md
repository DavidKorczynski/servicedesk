# CNCF ServiceDesk

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) provides a variety of services and benefits to our projects to help make them more successful. The list below essentially represents each of the services that we have in the past provided to any project. We remain open to providing additional services, so if there are things you would like that are not listed, or if you have an issue but have not yet formulated your exact request, please still reach out to us.

To improve access to CNCF services, we are implementing a service desk to serve as a single point access for all CNCF services. We’re modeling this on the 3-1-1 service that Mayor Bloomberg [rolled out](http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/203-10/mayor-bloomberg-answers-100-millionth-call-311) in New York City to provide single point of access to all municipal services. Project maintainers that are used to interacting with CNCF staff members directly by email or Slack are welcome to continue to do so, and it will be that staff member’s responsibility to log the request in the CNCF ServiceDesk.

CNCF’s services fall in the following general categories:

* Foundation
* Event management (host your own event or have a track)
* Program management (governance, staff, third-party services)
* Marketing services and programs (webinars, blogs, case studies, newsletters)
* Marketing communications (press and analyst relations, social media management)
* Certification and training services (expert certification, software conformance, training)
* Legal services (trademark, copyright, patents, licenses)
* Internationalization

## Foundation

* The CNCF provides a variety of services and benefits to our projects to help make them more successful. Neutrality requires that projects contribute their trademark to CNCF so that: no company is favored over any other and CNCF ensures project governance is transparent and fair for everyone.
* A neutral home for your project increases the willingness of developers from other enterprise software companies, start-ups and independent developers to collaborate, contribute, and become committers
* Endorsement by members of the CNCF’s [Technical Oversight Committee](http://github.com/cncf/toc) is an independent signal of the quality of your project
* Engagement with the CNCF’s End User community of leading companies doing cutting-edge cloud native deployments
* Existing committers still control your project, and we just ask that you document a neutral governance process
* Tens of thousands of dollars per year to improve project documentation
* Maintain your committers, just commit to an unbiased process to elect additional committers

## Tools

Projects have the free to use their own tools in CNCF but there are certain tools we recommend and have relationships with:

* Zoom video conferencing Pro accounts for video meetings, recordings, and scheduling
* OpsGenie account for on-call rotations for production services, security disclosure lists, or other needs
* LastPass to manage to shared secrets
* Netlify for improved workflow/automation around documentation and websites
* Discourse for community discussion (e.g., https://discuss.kubernetes.io)
* [FOSSA](https://fossa.io) for license and security scanning

## Program Management

* Collaborate with our full-time press and analyst relations teams to increase awareness and excitement of the projects
* Receive regular reports on press mentions and comparisons to similar projects
* Leverage the expertise of its parent organization, The Linux Foundation, which hosts other successful projects including Hyperledger, ONAP, the Linux kernel, Let’s Encrypt, and Node.js. For example, CNCF arranged a collaboration between Kubernetes developers and Linux Foundation fellow and stable kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman to [discuss](https://www.linux.com/news/greg-kroah-hartman-gives-inside-look-largest-fastest-software-project-all) high-velocity software development techniques
* Access to full-time CNCF staff who are eager to assist your project in myriad ways and help make it successful
* Participate in the CNCF cross-project, cross-cloud continuous integration [program](https://github.com/cncf/cross-cloud/)
* Security audits by independent third parties (e.g., https://coredns.io/2018/03/15/cure53-security-assessment/)

## Event Management

* Events are a part of CNCF’s core strategy and they help your project build a community with face-to-face interaction and knowledge sharing
* Create a track for your project at our [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon](http://kubecon.io/) events with our world-class events team, bringing together vendors, developers and end users. We host events every year in Europe, China, and North America. In addition, we can help create a custom conference for you
* Run events targeted specifically for your project (like [PromCon](https://promcon.io/) or [EnvoyCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/envoycon/)), and/or be a sponsor at those events
* Travel funding available for your non-corporate-backed developers and to increase  attendance of women and other underrepresented minorities
* Connect to our worldwide network of Cloud Native [meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf/) and ambassadors to raise awareness of your project. We will also help sponsor meetup groups dedicated to your project so food and beverages can be provided
* Host a set of well-received networking events with leading VCs, which provides additional visibility for projects
* CNCF assists with the events of its parent, the Linux Foundation, which are called Open Source Summits (OSS) and held every year in [North America](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america), [Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe), [Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-japan-2018/), and [China](https://www.lfasiallc.com/events/lc3-2018/), as well as the invitation-only Open Source Leadership Summit
* CNCF assists with sponsorship leads, media introductions, co-location opportunities and marketing of the event
* CNCF sponsors over 30 third-party cloud events each year including, OSCON, Google Next, AWS Reinvent, DockerCon, Microsoft Build and more
* We [promote](https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn/status/862384302113251328) all CNCF projects and for questions, our staff and volunteers can’t answer, we forward them to the relevant project owner
* Project contributors are welcome to use our booth as a "home base" for meeting colleagues
* CNCF organizes smaller events like the Kubernetes Software Conformance Working Group [meetings](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance#past-meetings--presentations) for 10-30 people every couple months

## Marketing Services and Programs

CNCF provides a full portfolio of marketing services to support community and ecosystem engagement, including:

* Content ranges from webinars, CNCF blog, Kubernetes blogs, KubeWeekly, case studies, newsletters, presentations etc
* Oversee blog editorial calendars and writing, editing, and/or identifying and funding freelancers to develop content

We remain open to providing additional services, so if there are things you would like that is not listed, or if you have an issue but have not yet formulated your exact request, please still reach out to us at [info@cncf.io](mailto:info@cncf.io).

## Internationalization

We offer internationalization support for projects that require blog posts translated into Chinese or other languages. For examples, see the [TiKV](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/28/cncf-to-host-tikv-in-the-sandbox/) and [Harbor](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/) blog posts.

### China

We have a professional staff located in China that can help your project present at local meetups and events. Also, we host one of the largest open source conferences, [KubeCon+CloudNativeCon China](https://www.lfasiallc.com/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-china-2018/) every year and offer simultaneous live translations of presentations in both Chinese and English.
