# CNCF ServiceDesk

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) provides a variety of services and benefits to our projects to help make them more successful. The list below essentially represents each of the services that we have in the past provided to any project. We remain open to providing additional services, so if there are things you would like that are not listed, or if you have an issue but have not yet formulated your exact request, please still reach out to us.

To improve access to CNCF services, we are implementing a service desk to serve as a single point access for all CNCF services. We’re modeling this on the 3-1-1 service that Mayor Bloomberg [rolled out](http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/203-10/mayor-bloomberg-answers-100-millionth-call-311) in New York City to provide single point of access to all municipal services. Project maintainers that are used to interacting with CNCF staff members directly by email or Slack are welcome to continue to do so, and it will be that staff member’s responsibility to log the request in the CNCF ServiceDesk.

CNCF’s services fall in the following general categories:

* Program management (governance help, legal help, contractors, third-party services)
* Event management (host your own event or have a track)
* Creative services (project artwork, websites and logos)
* Public relations (including analyst relations and social media management) 
* Marketing (case studies, store)
* Certification (expert certification, software conformance, training)
* Legal (trademark, copyright, patents, licenses)

On top of these services, it is our opinion that the biggest value of CNCF, by far, is that a neutral home for your project increases the willingness of developers from other companies and independent developers to collaborate, contribute, and become committers. Neutrality requires that projects contribute their trademark to CNCF so that no company is favored over any other and CNCF ensures project governance is transparent and fair for everyone.

## Service Desk Process

If you’re a CNCF project committer, all you have to do is visit http://servicedesk.cncf.io or email servicedesk@cncf.io to request support.

## Event Services

Events are a part of CNCF’s core strategy and they help your project build a community with face-to-face interaction and knowledge sharing.

* CNCF manages three large events every year, and ensures tracks for each CNCF project.

    * [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/)

    * [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2018/)

    * [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon China](https://www.lfasiallc.com/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-china-2018/)

    * Prior to those meetings, we have organized SIG gatherings, hack-fests and other related activities.

* CNCF assists with the events of its parent, the Linux Foundation, which are called Open Source Summits (OSS) and held every year in [North America](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america), [Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe), Japan and China, as well as the invitation-only Open Source Leadership Summit.

    * We can sometimes help arrange speaking slots, and OSS Summits are a great opportunity for post-conference meetings.

    * For example, CNCF is sponsoring the containerd portion of the [Moby Summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america/extend-the-experience/co-located-events) the day after OSS LA.

    * We also arranged a Cloud Native evening [meetup](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america/extend-the-experience/co-located-events) during the event that will be covering Kubernetes, security and Istio.

* We can assist our project in running their own events. Those can be attached to a CNCF or third-party event or standalone

    * For Prometheus, we have helped arrange the logistics of [PromCon](https://promcon.io/2018-munich/), while leaving all content decisions to the maintainers

        * Specifically, we helped arrange the 5 diamond sponsors (CNCF is one) and are holding the funds. The allocation of all funds (including any unspent amounts) remains up to the maintainers.

        * We also arranged for 2 reporters to attend the event.

    * For Kubernetes, we are providing the space, Wi-Fi, AV, etc. for the Kubernetes Dev Summit (held the day before or after CloudNativeCon + KubeCon).

    * We sponsored a fluentd [mini-summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-japan/extend-the-experience/co-located-events) at OSS Tokyo.

    * We can assist with sponsorship leads, media introductions, co-location opportunities and marketing of the event

* CNCF sponsors several third-party cloud events each year including DockerCon, OpenStack Summit, OSCON, Google Next, AWS Reinvent and Microsoft Build

    * We [promote](https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn/status/862384302113251328) all CNCF projects and for questions our staff and volunteers can’t answer, we forward them to the relevant project

    * Project contributors are welcome to use our booth as a "home base" for meeting colleagues

* CNCF also organizes smaller events like the Kubernetes Software Conformance Working Group [meetings](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance#past-meetings--presentations) for 10-30 people every couple months.

* We have been hosting a set of well-received networking [events](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/06/01/open-source-software-fuels-explosive-startup-growth-goes-mainstream/) with leading VCs, which provides additional visibility for our projects

## Marketing Services

CNCF provides a full portfolio of marketing services to support community and ecosystem engagement, including:

* Marketing strategy and programs to support key initiatives such as events, training and certification, content creation, management of web presence and more

    * Content ranges from blogs and other website content to white papers, case studies, newsletters, presentations, and collateral such as data sheets 

* Marketing automation and email support, landing pages to support event marketing, content, or other engagement strategies 

* Quarterly project media velocity reports (e.g., for [gRPC](http://app.trendkite.com/report?id=b49bd64d-55d0-4ab5-81f4-51e755137073))

* Pre-ordered, project-branded swag via CNCF [store](https://store.cncf.io/)

* Help develop project website

    * For example, CNCF recently took over [management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SapnZjwMwAjfc-7SqWFA9GYUcnr4lbpv7cEKioqpwoU/edit#heading=h.82uhsthul12l) of kubernetes.io from Google

    * We completed a redesign of [coredns.io](https://coredns.io/) while the project maintainers continue to [manage](https://github.com/coredns/coredns.io) it.

We work to generate positive media and analyst coverage to create greater awareness of project milestones, community growth, and developer engagement. Services include:

* Promote project news and milestones through work with journalists and analysts and news releases/blogs

* Identify top publications/podcasts (ArchiTECHt, Bloomberg, Changelog, eWeek, Fortune, Forbes, InfoWorld, The New Stack, etc.) and develop plans to earn coverage in them through contributed articles, quotes, interviews, and news pick-up

* Develop thought leadership reports, surveys, success stories, and case studies (print and video)

* Manage social media channels (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube)

* Identify leading analysts and develop messaging and materials

* Secure analyst briefings for inclusion in reports: Gartner, Forrester, IDC, RedMonk, 451 Research and more (e.g., Forrester report by Charlie Dai and Dave Bartoletti, "Vendor Landscape: Container Solutions For Cloud-Native Applications") 

* Coordinate speakers’ bureaus for key maintainers/developers (e.g., user, developer-driven conference panels) 

* Organize media/analyst luncheons, 1:1 meetings at key events

    * For example, we are arranging to have over 30 press and analysts attend CloudNativeCon + KubeCon in Austin, and we help schedule back-to-back meetings with project maintainers and contributors for many of them

* Oversee blog editorial calendars and writing, editing, and/or identifying and funding freelancers to develop content

## Certification and Training Services

CNCF has made a major investment over the last year to implement training, expert certification and provider certification programs for Kubernetes. Over time, we expect to expand these to cover other projects as well. 

* Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam
* Remotely proctored, hands-on command-line exam tests knowledge, skills, and abilities that a Certified Kubernetes Administrator can be expected to demonstrate
* CNCF is working with The Linux Foundation training team to develop self-paced online courses that can scale up a project’s reach beyond what’s possible using instructor-led courses
* Free Introduction to Kubernetes course on edX MOOC: 5,500+ enrollments within days of launch
* Kubernetes Fundamentals course (700 enrollments in e-learning course within days)

## Legal Services

* CNCF legal resources respond to threatened litigation (e.g., we worked with the Kubespray maintainers to change their name back from Kargo after receiving a cease and desist letter)
* CLA system that integrates with GitHub (identity.linuxfoundation.org/projects/cncf)
* DCO system that integrates with GitHub
* Access to CNCF and LF staff shall any legal questions arise
* We protect trademarks, such as a UDRP action to take over kubernetes.cn.

## Additional Services

* Engagement with End User Board
* Tens of thousands of dollars per year to improve your project documentation
* Maintain your committers; just commit to an unbiased process to elect additional committers
* Maintaining third party services like LastPass to share credentials
* Help organize security response process. 
* Vetting partners
